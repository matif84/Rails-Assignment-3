Make a new Rails app from the ground up. Create a User model and a Post model. Associate the models so that one User can have many Posts. 
Create a RESTful routing scheme that allows the display of a user at /users/:id, a list of all the users at /users, and the ability to delete a user by sending a DELETE request to /users/:id. 
Create a nested resource for posts (see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#nested-resources) that allows you to see all of a user’s posts at /users/:id/posts
When you’re done, commit your project to a new Git repo and push it to GitHub. Submit the link on Canvas
